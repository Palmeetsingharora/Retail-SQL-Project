# Retail Sales SQL Analysis Project

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of retail sales data to answer key business questions and support data-driven decision-making. The database captures detailed transaction-level information including sales, customer demographics, product categories, time-of-sale, and financial metrics.

## Key Objectives

- Clean and prepare raw sales data for accurate analysis.
- Explore data for basic business metrics (total sales, unique customers, product categories).
- Solve targeted business questions related to:
  - Daily, monthly, and category-wise sales trends
  - Customer segmentation and top-performing customers
  - Time-of-day (shift) analysis
  - High-value transactions and gender-based sales insights

## Structure

1. **Database & Table Creation:**  
   Scripts to initialize the retail sales database and define the required schema.

2. **Data Cleaning:**  
   Identification and removal of incomplete or null records to ensure data quality.

3. **Data Exploration:**  
   Preliminary queries to understand the data—total sales, customer count, categories.

4. **Business Analysis & Reporting:**  
   Advanced queries to extract actionable insights for management and business strategy.

## Sample Business Questions Addressed

- What are the total sales and unique customers?
- Which product categories and time periods drive the most revenue?
- Who are our top 5 customers by total sales?
- How do sales patterns differ by gender, category, and time of day?
- What is the best-selling month in each year?
- Which transactions or customers contribute most to revenue?

## Results & Insights
Through a comprehensive SQL-driven analysis of the retail sales database, I uncovered several actionable business insights that demonstrate the power of data-driven decision-making. By first cleaning and preparing the data, I ensured that subsequent analyses were both accurate and reliable. My initial exploration revealed nearly 2,000 sales transactions across 155 unique customers, reflecting a healthy and diverse customer base. The dataset spanned three main product categories—Electronics, Clothing, and Beauty—enabling detailed comparisons and segmentation.

Delving deeper, I analyzed sales trends by month and year, uncovering that average sales peaked in March 2022 and August 2023, signaling potential seasonality and helping inform future promotional strategies. Segmenting the customer base, I identified the top five customers whose cumulative purchases significantly outpaced the average, providing clear opportunities for targeted loyalty programs and high-value engagement.

Category-level insights were further enhanced by examining unique customer participation, offering guidance for personalized marketing efforts. Additionally, by breaking down sales activity across different shifts, I found that the majority of transactions occurred in the evening, suggesting that staffing and marketing resources should be concentrated during these peak hours for maximum impact.

This end-to-end analysis not only illustrates my proficiency in advanced SQL querying and data wrangling but also my ability to transform raw transactional data into clear business recommendations. The skills demonstrated in this project are directly transferable to real-world business analytics and strategic decision-making roles.



## SQL Dialect

> **Note:** These queries are written for PostgreSQL. For other database systems (like MySQL, SQL Server), function names may need adjustment.

## How to Use

1. Import and run the SQL script in your PostgreSQL environment.
2. Review and adapt queries for your business needs or data structure.
3. Use the results to guide business decisions in sales, marketing, and customer engagement.
